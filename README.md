# Notes App

This project is a simple note taking application built with Express for the backend and Editor.js for the frontend editor. Bundling is handled by Parcel.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Running this ensures that modules such as `editorjs-html` are available to Parcel.
2. During development run the dev server which builds the frontend with Parcel:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. In another terminal you can start the API server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Run the test suite with:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
